Sexy Buttons
============

This plugin that will generate the necessary files to use sexy buttons as outlined
in Particletree article about rediscovering the button element: 
  
  http://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element/
  
It will also provide you with some nice (magical) button helpers named after the icons
themselves, so it's like an abstraction of the famfamfam/silk icons into a rails button 
suite...
  
INSTALLATION
============

1. rake sexy_buttons:install, this will copy the css files and the famfamfam
   icons into /images/sexy_buttons/
2. put <%= bring_sexy_back %> in your layout file, preferably in the head section 

USAGE
=====

Simply use the sexy_buttons block to add your buttons and you can reference any type
of button by the name of the image (in the sexy_buttons dir):

EXAMPLE:

  <% sexy_buttons do %>
    
    <%= submit 'Submit Form' %>
    <%= accept_button 'Accept', post_path %>
    
  <% end %>
  
What's real cool is that the button method names are automatically generated based on 
the name of of the icons. So if you know the name of the icon, then you know the name 
of the method.
